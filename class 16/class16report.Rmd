#Section 1. Differential Expression Analysis

```{r}
library(DESeq2)

metaFile <- "GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

# Import metadata and take a peak
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)
```

```{r}
# Import countdata
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)
```

***Q.*** Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from

```{r}
# Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```

***Q.*** Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

```{r}
# Filter count data where you have 0 read count across all samples.
countData = countData[rowSums(countData) > 1, ]
head(countData)
```

Running DESeq2

```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```
```{r}
dds
```

```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast=c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
```


***Q.*** Call the summary() function on your results to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default 0.1 p-value cutoff.

```{r}
summary(res[order(res$pvalue),])
```

Volcano plot

```{r}
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```

***Q.*** Improve this plot by completing the below code, which adds color and axis labels

```{r}
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (res$padj < 0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
```

Adding gene annotation

***Q.*** Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.


```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res, 10)
```

***Q.*** Finally for this section let's reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, file="deseq_results.csv")
```

#Section 2. Pathway Analysis

KEGG pathways

```{r}
# Run in your R console (i.e. not your Rmarkdown doc!)
#BiocManager::install( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )

# For old vesrsions of R only (R < 3.5.0)!
#source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#biocLite( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
library(pathview)
```

```{r}
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

## Focus on top 5 up-regulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

***Q:*** What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

The Endosomal/Vacuolar pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value” (8.64E-4), and the most significant pathways listed do not match my previous KEGG results. Based on the observation of these two methods' pathway demonstration, I think that these two databases contain different representations of the same biological pathway (the two databases will not agree on the level of granularity for describing a given process), which could lead to different results of statistical enrichment analysis and predictive models in different contexts, causing differences between the two methods for conducting over-representation enrichment analysis and pathway-topology analysis.

#Section 5. GO online (OPTIONAL)

***Q:*** What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

The Unclassified and detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception pathways have the most significant FDR p-values (5.95E-60 and 6.34E-60), and the most significant pathways listed do not match my previous KEGG results. As the two databases will not agree on the level of granularity for describing a given process, it could cause differences between the two methods.
